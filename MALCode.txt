; The MAL Code will add number from decimal value of 1 through 5 EOL

       MOVEI 0, R8    ; first summation number (temporary index which will store 0-5) EOL 
       MOVEI 5, R1   ; last summation number, R1 = 5 EOL
       MOVEI 0, R2    ; temporary summation (running total) which is initialized as 0 EOL
check: BEQ R2, R1, done  ; check if R1 == R2, if R2 == 5, it will branch to Done EOL
sum:   INC R0         ; the first number is increased by 1 EOL
       ADDD R2, R0, R2 ; R2+R0 = R2 (R2 is a new running total) EOL
       INC, R0         ; increase by 1 EOL
BR     check          ; branch to the address label - check EOL
